I will be using the pollster from USA about the exit poll results of US election conducted in 2008. 
As we all know former president Barak Obama won the election in that election. Poll was conducted from 3 kinds of people RV, LV and A. RV is the registered voters who are leagal to vote. 
LV is the people who participated in the survey who are likely to vote. A is the poplation of Adults who shared opinion on the pollster.

	Columns obama and macain are provided with percentage of votes they recieved in the pollster. All values in these feilds has to be considered as percentages not actual votes/polls they received.
